  A simple todo app built using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JS, and SQLite
  
  The only dependancy that is not built-in into Python is Flask. Tested in Firefox and Google Chrome browsers.
  
  ## Run
  
  Just run `py app.py` from the terminal in the repository folder (or click play in VS Code).
  The database file is already created in the /static/ folder.

  It was a fun project to build! I learned a lot from this.
